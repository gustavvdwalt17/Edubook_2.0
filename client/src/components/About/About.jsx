      <small>This is my first full stack website and everything i used to build this App i learned using resources like, Youtube, Udemy etc.

        This app was made for fun and the concept is allowing Eduvos students, where i study, to buy and sells their textbooks. The reason for building this is i saw alot of people advertising their textbooks on our whatsApp groups. I then decided this will be a cool first project to develop.</small>
